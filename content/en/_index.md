This is a demo site for the [Hugo zen theme](https://github.com/frjo/hugo-theme-zen) (GitHub).

Source code for [Zen demo site](https://github.com/frjo/zen-demo) (GitHub).

This is the theme I have built to have a good base for all my own Hugo projects. I normally extend it during new projects when I come up with fixes and solutions that I think will be generally useful.

I am happy to see that other people also have found it useful.

## Styles

What you see here is the base reset CSS plus the Zen styles. I fully expect most users of this theme will remove the Zen styles. They are a set of styles I happen to often use in my own projects.

To make this theme look like anything you need to add your own custom styling to it. It is a **base** theme after all.
